A monarch butterfly just fluttered past me
curious and inquisitive
exploring the screen door to my bedroom
exploring the screen door to the kitchen
exploring the garden
exploring the trees
and the warmth I feel reminds me of Charlie
who I know has fluttered past me

Dark mode is great for dark times
Light mode is for lounging in the sun
